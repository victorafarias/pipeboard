# Streamable HTTP Transport Setup

## Overview

Meta Ads MCP supports **Streamable HTTP Transport**, which allows you to run the server as a standalone HTTP API. This enables direct integration with web applications, custom dashboards, and any system that can make HTTP requests.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the HTTP Server

```bash
# Basic HTTP server (default: localhost:8080)
python -m meta_ads_mcp --transport streamable-http

# Custom host and port
python -m meta_ads_mcp --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

Organic Facebook Page / Instagram publishing is a **separate** MCP:

```bash
python -m meta_posts_mcp --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8084
```

The posts server uses the same `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `Authorization: Bearer` auth as Meta Ads MCP. The token must include `pages_manage_posts` and `instagram_content_publish`.

### 2. Set Authentication

When you run this server yourself, the credential is a **Meta access token** from
your own Meta app — create one at
[developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). A Pipeboard API
token will not work here: the server passes whatever you give it straight to the
Meta Graph API.

```bash
export META_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_meta_access_token
```

Setting this is optional for the HTTP transport if you pass the token per request
in a header (see [Security Model](#security-model-read-before-exposing-the-port)),
but it is convenient for command-line use.

> Want to authenticate with a Pipeboard API token instead, and never handle a Meta
> token? Use the hosted MCP at `https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` rather than
> running this server. (`PIPEBOARD_API_TOKEN` is no longer supported by this
> package — see [Migration](#migration-from-stdio).)

### 3. Make HTTP Requests

The server accepts JSON-RPC 2.0 requests at the `/mcp` endpoint. Use the `Authorization` header to provide your token.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_meta_access_token" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "id": 1,
    "params": {
      "name": "get_ad_accounts",
      "arguments": {"limit": 5}
    }
  }'
```

## Configuration Options

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--transport` | Transport mode | `stdio` |
| `--host` | Server host address | `localhost` |
| `--port` | Server port | `8080` |
| `--sse-response` | Return responses as SSE streams instead of JSON | `false` (JSON) |

### Examples

```bash
# Local development server
python -m meta_ads_mcp --transport streamable-http --host localhost --port 8080

# Production server (accessible externally)
python -m meta_ads_mcp --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Custom port
python -m meta_ads_mcp --transport streamable-http --port 9000
```

## Security Model (read before exposing the port)

The HTTP transport uses a **per-request** authentication model that is
deliberately different from stdio. Understanding it is the difference between a
safe deployment and leaking your Meta account to the internet.

- **stdio (local):** the server acts as whatever credential is configured in its
  environment — `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` or a stored login from the local OAuth flow.
  Only the local process that launched it can talk to it, so this is expected
  and safe. *If all you want is to use the MCP locally, prefer stdio.*

- **streamable-http (network):** every request must carry **its own** token
  header — `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `X-META-ACCESS-TOKEN`, or the legacy
  `X-PIPEBOARD-API-TOKEN`. Requests without one are rejected with
  `401 Unauthorized`. The server-side `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is
  **intentionally not** used as an implicit fallback for HTTP requests — if it
  were, any caller who can reach the port would act as you. This gating is
  enforced by `AuthInjectionMiddleware`.

**Operational rules:**

1. **Do not expose the raw port to an untrusted network.** `--host 0.0.0.0`
   binds to every interface. Put the server behind an authenticating reverse
   proxy (or a private network / firewall), exactly as the hosted MCP at
   `*.mcp.pipeboard.co` does (localhost-bound Python process behind a proxy).
2. **Avoid setting `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` on a network-exposed HTTP server.** It is
   an operator-wide, long-lived credential. Have callers pass their own tokens
   in headers instead. If you must set it (e.g. single-tenant behind a trusted
   proxy), ensure the port is unreachable by untrusted callers.
3. **The auth gate applies in both response modes** — default JSON and
   `--sse-response`. (Historically `--sse-response` had a bug where the gate was
   not attached to the served app; see `SECURITY.md`, GHSA-8353-5qhw-8hfw. Fixed
   in `1.0.119` — upgrade if you use `--sse-response`.)
4. **If you ever exposed an unauthenticated server, rotate the Meta access
   token** and review Graph API access logs.

## Authentication

Which credential you use depends on **who runs the server**.

### Self-hosted: Meta access token

When you run this package yourself, supply a Meta access token from your own Meta
app. Create one at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/),
then pass it in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_meta_access_token" \
     -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

The `X-META-ACCESS-TOKEN` header is equivalent:

```bash
curl -H "X-META-ACCESS-TOKEN: your_meta_access_token" \
     -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

### Hosted: Pipeboard API token

The hosted Remote MCP at `https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` accepts a **Pipeboard
API token** instead, so you never handle a Meta token yourself. Pipeboard resolves
the Meta credential server-side and enforces the API token's account and permission
scoping on every call.

1. Sign up at [Pipeboard.co](https://pipeboard.co)
2. Generate an API token at [pipeboard.co/api-tokens](https://pipeboard.co/api-tokens)
3. Point your MCP client at `https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` with
   `Authorization: Bearer <your_pipeboard_token>`

For clients that cannot send headers, the token may be passed as a URL parameter:

```
https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/?token=YOUR_PIPEBOARD_TOKEN
```

> A Pipeboard API token only works against the hosted endpoint. Passing one to a
> server you run yourself will fail, because that server forwards the token
> directly to the Meta Graph API.

            payload["params"]["arguments"] = arguments
        
        response = requests.post(self.endpoint, headers=self.headers, json=payload)
        return response.json()

# Usage
client = MetaAdsMCPClient(token="your_meta_access_token")
result = client.call_tool("get_ad_accounts", {"limit": 5})
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

### JavaScript/Node.js Client

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

class MetaAdsMCPClient {
    constructor(baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8080', token = null) {
        this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
        this.endpoint = `${baseUrl}/mcp`;
        this.headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Accept': 'application/json, text/event-stream'
        };
        if (token) {
            this.headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
        }
    }

    async callTool(toolName, arguments = null) {
        const payload = {
            jsonrpc: '2.0',
            method: 'tools/call',
            id: 1,
            params: { name: toolName }
        };
        if (arguments) {
            payload.params.arguments = arguments;
        }

        try {
            const response = await axios.post(this.endpoint, payload, { headers: this.headers });
            return response.data;
        } catch (error) {
            return { error: error.message };
        }
    }
}

// Usage
const client = new MetaAdsMCPClient('http://localhost:8080', 'your_meta_access_token');
client.callTool('get_ad_accounts', { limit: 5 })
    .then(result => console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)));
```

## Production Deployment

### Security Considerations

See **[Security Model](#security-model-read-before-exposing-the-port)** above for
the per-request auth model and why it matters. In short:

1. **Use HTTPS**: In production, run behind a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
2. **Authentication**: Every request must carry its own token header; the server
   returns `401` otherwise. Do not rely on a server-side `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` as
   an implicit credential for HTTP callers — it is not used as a fallback.
3. **Network Security**: Never expose the raw port to an untrusted network. Bind
   to localhost behind an authenticating proxy, or restrict with firewalls.
4. **Avoid `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` on network-exposed servers**: it is an
   operator-wide credential; prefer per-request header tokens.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for public APIs

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -e .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["python", "-m", "meta_ads_mcp", "--transport", "streamable-http", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Meta access token from your own Meta app. Used for stdio; for HTTP it can
# also be passed per request in the Authorization header.
export META_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_meta_access_token

# Optional (for the local OAuth flow instead of a direct token)
export META_APP_ID=your_app_id
export META_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret

# Optional (for direct Meta token).
# WARNING: on the HTTP transport this is NOT used as a fallback credential for
# incoming requests — callers must pass their own token header (see "Security
# Model"). Setting it on a network-exposed server is an operator-wide credential
# risk; prefer stdio, or keep the port unreachable by untrusted callers.
export META_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**: Ensure the server is running and accessible on the specified port.
2. **Authentication Failed**: Verify your Bearer token is valid and included in the `Authorization` header.
3. **404 Not Found**: Make sure you're using the correct endpoint (`/mcp`).
4. **JSON-RPC Errors**: Check that your request follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 format.

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting the log level in your environment if the application supports it, or check the application's logging configuration. The current implementation logs to a file.

### Health Check

Test if the server is running by sending a `tools/list` request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

## Migration from stdio

If you're currently using stdio transport with MCP clients, you can support both stdio for local clients and HTTP for web applications. The application can only run in one mode at a time, so you may need to run two separate instances if you need both simultaneously.

1. **Keep existing MCP client setup** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) using stdio.
2. **Add HTTP transport** for web applications and custom integrations by running a separate server instance with the `--transport streamable-http` flag.
3. **Use the same authentication method**:
    - For stdio, the `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is used.
    - For HTTP, pass the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

> **Removed:** `PIPEBOARD_API_TOKEN` used to exchange a Pipeboard API token for the
> underlying Meta access token. That exchange has been removed, because the Meta
> token it returned ignored the scoping on the API token that requested it. Either
> set `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` from your own Meta app, or use the hosted MCP at
> `https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/`.

Both transports access the same Meta Ads functionality and use the same underlying authentication system.
