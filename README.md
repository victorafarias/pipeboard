# Meta Ads MCP

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets AI assistants — Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor, or any MCP client — run your Meta Ads end to end: launch campaigns, upload creatives, update budgets, and analyze performance through natural conversation across Facebook, Instagram, and every Meta ad surface. Available as a **hosted remote MCP** — no developer token, no self-hosting required.

This is the **Meta Ads node** of the [Pipeboard](https://pipeboard.co) MCP family — five remote MCP servers (Meta, Google, TikTok, Snap, Reddit) plus a unified [Pipeboard CLI](https://github.com/pipeboard-co/pipeboard-cli), **230+ tools** in total, one auth, one safety model. If you are comparing single-platform MCPs, you are looking at one node of a network — see [The Pipeboard MCP Family](#the-pipeboard-mcp-family) below.

> **Note:** This is an independent open-source project that uses Meta's public APIs. The hosted service behind it — [Pipeboard](https://pipeboard.co) — is a **badged Meta Business Partner** and an officially approved Meta app that manages **Meta, Google, TikTok, Snap & Reddit Ads** from one login (with a free plan) — so it is neither Meta-only nor something you have to self-host. Meta, Facebook, Instagram, and other Meta brand names are trademarks of their respective owners.

## The Pipeboard MCP Family

Pipeboard ships a remote [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for every major ad platform — plus a single-binary [CLI](https://github.com/pipeboard-co/pipeboard-cli) that wraps all of them. **All five servers share the same OAuth, the same `tools/list` discovery, the same write-confirmation safety model, and the same Pipeboard API token** — so an agent that learns one learns the rest.

### Remote MCP servers

| Platform | Remote MCP URL | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| **Meta Ads MCP** (Facebook + Instagram) | `https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` | **42 tools** — campaigns, ad sets, ads, creatives (incl. dynamic creative testing), image upload, insights, interest / behavior / demographic / geo targeting, page management |
| **Google Ads MCP** | `https://google-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` | **59 tools** — campaigns, ad groups, responsive search ads, Performance Max, keywords, GAQL queries, extensions (sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets), audiences, asset uploads, generic mutate |
| **TikTok Ads MCP** | `https://tiktok-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` | **59 tools** — campaigns, ad groups, ads, identities, image and video upload, audience and creative management, insights |
| **Snap Ads MCP** | `https://snap-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` | **37 tools** — ad accounts, campaigns, ad squads, ads, creatives, media upload, insights |
| **Reddit Ads MCP** | `https://reddit-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/` | **33 tools** — accounts, campaigns, ad groups, ads, performance reports |

**That is 230+ tools across five ad platforms behind one auth.** Plug any of these URLs into Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, Perplexity, or any MCP-compatible client. Connect your ad accounts once at [pipeboard.co](https://pipeboard.co) and every client gets access.

### Pipeboard CLI — the same tools, in your shell

[**Pipeboard CLI**](https://github.com/pipeboard-co/pipeboard-cli) is a single Go binary that exposes every MCP tool above as a typed shell command — built for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cline, OpenClaw, Codex) and automation scripts that prefer subprocess calls over JSON-RPC:

```bash
brew install pipeboard-co/tap/pipeboard
export PIPEBOARD_API_TOKEN=<your-token>

pipeboard meta-ads get-campaigns   --account-id act_123
pipeboard google-ads execute-gaql-query   --customer-id 1234567890 --query "..."
pipeboard tiktok-ads get-campaigns --advertiser-id 7605685552884596737
```

Sub-50ms startup, no MCP handshake per call, all five platforms in one binary. Full docs in the [pipeboard-cli repo](https://github.com/pipeboard-co/pipeboard-cli).

### Why a family instead of one MCP per repo?

- **One account, every platform** — auth once at [pipeboard.co](https://pipeboard.co); manage Meta + Google + TikTok + Snap + Reddit from the same agent session
- **Cross-platform questions get cross-platform answers** — "which channel had the cheapest signups last week?" actually works
- **Same safety contract everywhere** — writes are explicit, new campaigns start paused where the platform supports it, and confirmation prompts look identical across all five servers
- **One token, one rate-limit ceiling, one place to revoke** — no juggling separate OAuth flows or per-vendor installs

Single-platform MCP benchmarks miss the point. The value is the network, not the node.

### How Pipeboard compares

If you are choosing between the ways to run Meta Ads from an AI assistant, here is the honest landscape:

| | **Pipeboard** | **Meta's official MCP** | **Open-source / self-hosted servers** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Platforms** | Meta + Google + TikTok + Snap + Reddit, one login | Meta only | Usually Meta only |
| **Setup** | Hosted remote MCP — no developer token, ~2 minutes | Hosted by Meta (Meta only) | Self-host, manage your own tokens & upgrades |
| **Trust** | Badged Meta Business Partner + approved Meta app | First-party (Meta) | Varies — audit the code yourself |
| **Safety** | Explicit confirmation on every write; new campaigns start paused | Meta-defined | You build the guardrails |
| **Price** | Free plan, then paid tiers | Free (open beta) | Free, but you run the infra |

Meta's official connector is the safest **single-platform** option. Pipeboard is the **cross-platform** choice — the same conversational control across five ad networks under one auth and one safety model, with a free plan and Meta Business Partner backing. Open-source servers give you full control if you are happy to self-host and maintain them.

## Getting started with Remote MCP (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started is to **[🚀 Get started with our Meta Ads Remote MCP](https://pipeboard.co)**. Our cloud service uses streamable HTTP transport for reliable, scalable access to your Meta Ads account. No technical setup required — just connect and start launching, updating, and analyzing campaigns with AI!

### For Claude Pro/Max Users

1. Go to [claude.ai/settings/integrations](https://claude.ai/settings/integrations) (requires Claude Pro or Max)
2. Click "Add Integration" and enter:
   - **Name**: "Pipeboard Meta Ads" (or any name you prefer)
   - **Integration URL**: `https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/`
3. Click "Connect" next to the integration and follow the prompts to:
   - Login to Pipeboard
   - Connect your Facebook Ads account

That's it! You can now ask Claude to analyze your Meta ad campaigns, get performance insights, and manage your advertising.

#### Advanced: Direct Token Authentication (Claude)

For direct token-based authentication without the interactive flow, use this URL format when adding the integration:

```
https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/?token=YOUR_PIPEBOARD_TOKEN
```

Get your token at [pipeboard.co/api-tokens](https://pipeboard.co/api-tokens).

### For Cursor Users

Add the following to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`. Once you enable the remote MCP, click on "Needs login" to finish the login process.


```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meta-ads-remote": {
      "url": "https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Advanced: Direct Token Authentication (Cursor)

If you prefer to authenticate without the interactive login flow, you can include your Pipeboard API token directly in the URL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meta-ads-remote": {
      "url": "https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/?token=YOUR_PIPEBOARD_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

Get your token at [pipeboard.co/api-tokens](https://pipeboard.co/api-tokens).

### For Other MCP Clients

Use the Remote MCP URL: `https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/`

**[📖 Get detailed setup instructions for your AI client here](https://pipeboard.co)**

#### Advanced: Direct Token Authentication (OpenClaw and other clients)

For MCP clients that support token-based authentication, you can append your Pipeboard API token to the URL:

```
https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/?token=YOUR_PIPEBOARD_TOKEN
```

This bypasses the interactive login flow and authenticates immediately. Get your token at [pipeboard.co/api-tokens](https://pipeboard.co/api-tokens).

### Other platforms

Meta Ads is one of five remote MCP servers in the family — see [The Pipeboard MCP Family](#the-pipeboard-mcp-family) for Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snap Ads, and Reddit Ads, all set up the same way.

## Pipeboard CLI (Alternative to MCP)

If your agent prefers shell commands over JSON-RPC, the [Pipeboard CLI](https://github.com/pipeboard-co/pipeboard-cli) exposes every tool in the family as a typed subcommand — see [the family section above](#pipeboard-cli--the-same-tools-in-your-shell) for the quick install and the [pipeboard-cli repo](https://github.com/pipeboard-co/pipeboard-cli) for full docs.

## Local Installation (Advanced Technical Users Only)

🚀 **We strongly recommend using [Remote MCP](https://pipeboard.co) instead** - it's faster, more reliable, and requires no technical setup.

Meta Ads MCP also supports a local streamable HTTP transport, allowing you to run it as a standalone HTTP API for web applications and custom integrations. See **[Streamable HTTP Setup Guide](STREAMABLE_HTTP_SETUP.md)** for complete instructions.

## Meta Posts MCP (Facebook + Instagram organic)

The ads MCP does not publish to the Page or Instagram feed. **Meta Posts MCP** is a separate local server (`python -m meta_posts_mcp`) that uses the same Graph API and `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`, with tools for organic posts, comments, and insights.

Required token permissions: `pages_show_list`, `pages_manage_posts`, `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish` (plus `pages_manage_engagement` / `instagram_manage_comments` to reply). Instagram needs a professional (Business/Creator) account. Media URLs must be publicly fetchable by Meta.

```bash
python -m meta_posts_mcp --login
python -m meta_posts_mcp --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8084
```

Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`), alongside the ads server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meta-ads-remote": {
      "url": "https://meta-ads.mcp.pipeboard.co/"
    },
    "meta-posts": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "meta_posts_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "META_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_META_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Meta Posts tools

| Tool | Purpose |
